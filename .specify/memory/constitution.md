# Tubular Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Visual-First Design
Tubular programs must be visually readable and comprehensible as 2D pipe systems. The visual layout must clearly convey data flow paths and program logic. Code aesthetics directly impact program functionality and must be treated as a primary concern, not an afterthought.

### II. Deterministic Execution
Every Tubular program must execute deterministically given the same input and initial conditions. The dataflow model must be predictable and reproducible across different implementations. Randomness or non-deterministic behavior is strictly prohibited except for explicit input operations.

### III. Minimalist Character Set
The language must use only ASCII characters for program representation. Each character must have a single, well-defined semantic meaning. No character overloading or context-dependent semantics are permitted. The character set must remain small and memorable to maintain the esoteric language philosophy.

### IV. Test-Driven Language Design
All language features and implementations must be developed with comprehensive tests first. Every pipe type, operator, and language construct must have corresponding test cases that verify behavior, edge cases, and error conditions. Implementation cannot proceed without failing tests.

### V. Turing Completeness with Simplicity
While maintaining Turing completeness, the language must prioritize conceptual simplicity over practical performance. Complex algorithms should be possible but naturally encourage visual, dataflow-style solutions. The language should remain approachable for experimentation and learning despite its esoteric nature.

## Language Constraints

### Semantic Purity
Each Tubular program must be semantically valid according to the specification. No undefined behavior, implementation-specific quirks, or "undefined" results are permitted. Every program state must have a defined outcome or explicit error handling.

### Grid-Based Execution
Programs must execute on a 2D grid with discrete cell-based semantics. The spatial arrangement of characters is meaningful and cannot be abstracted away. Execution must preserve the visual nature of the language at all times.

### Dataflow Integrity
Data droplets must follow the pipe system with strict conservation principles unless explicitly destroyed or transformed by operators. No teleportation, arbitrary state changes, or violation of the fluid dynamics metaphor are permitted.

## Implementation Standards

### Reference Implementation Fidelity
All Tubular implementations must conform exactly to the language specification. Reference test suites must pass completely. No deviations, extensions, or "enhancements" are permitted without formal constitutional amendment.

### Cross-Platform Consistency
The same Tubular program must produce identical results across all compliant implementations regardless of platform, architecture, or implementation language. Implementation differences must not affect program behavior.

### Performance Constraints
While performance is not a primary concern, implementations must support the minimum requirements: 1000x1000 grid size, 1000-level stack depth, and arbitrary precision integers. Performance optimizations must not compromise semantic correctness.

### Guiding Principles for Development
Day-to-day development should reference the language specification and implementation guidelines for detailed requirements. This constitution provides the foundational principles that guide all technical decisions.
