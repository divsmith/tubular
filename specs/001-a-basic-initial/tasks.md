**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-a-basic-initial/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (completed), spec.md (completed for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY for this feature - comprehensive testing is required by constitution principle IV (Test-Driven Language Design). Test tasks are included for all core functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Paths below follow plan.md structure** for CLI interpreter project

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 core components
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses arithmetic operations from US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on all previous stories

### Within Each User Story

- Models/Types before Services/Operations
- Core operations before Integration/CLI
- Core implementation before testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Operations within stories marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all operations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement flow control operations in src/operations/flow_control.rs"
Task: "Implement data source operations in src/operations/arithmetic.rs"
Task: "Implement data sink operations in src/operations/io.rs"

# Launch all core components together:
Task: "Create core execution engine in src/interpreter/execution.rs"
Task: "Implement droplet movement and collision detection in src/interpreter/collision.rs"
Task: "Create main execution loop in src/interpreter/mod.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Hello World program independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test Hello World independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test I/O operations independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test arithmetic/logic independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test memory/subroutines independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core execution)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (I/O operations)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (arithmetic/logic)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (memory/subroutines)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on property-based testing for complex state transitions
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance targets: <10ms per tick, 1000+ concurrent droplets, <1000MB memory
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
