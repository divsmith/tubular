# Implementation Plan: Tubular Language Implementation

**Branch**: `001-a-basic-initial` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: specs/001-a-basic-initial/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-a-basic-initial/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Implement a basic interpreter for the Tubular programming language, a 2D grid-based language where droplets flow through pipes and perform operations.

**Technical Approach**:
- **Rust implementation** for performance and memory safety
- **Sparse grid representation** for memory efficiency with large programs
- **Droplet-based execution** with discrete tick simulation
- **Comprehensive testing** using property-based testing for complex state transitions
- **CLI interface** with debugging and benchmarking capabilities

**Key Features**:
- Support for 1000+ concurrent droplets
- 1000x1000 grid size support
- Arbitrary precision integer arithmetic
- Complete language feature set (flow control, I/O, memory, subroutines)
- Performance optimization for large-scale simulations

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+
**Primary Dependencies**: clap (CLI), ndarray (grids), num-bigint (arbitrary precision), proptest (testing)
**Storage**: File-based grid input (ASCII files)
**Testing**: cargo test + proptest + criterion
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI interpreter)
**Performance Goals**: Execute 1000+ concurrent droplets, <10ms per tick, support 1000x1000 grids
**Constraints**: <1000MB memory, arbitrary precision integers, stack depth ≥1000
**Scale/Scope**: Single interpreter executable supporting unlimited program sizes

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design. Constitution alignment verified.*

**Constitution Status**: ✓ Constitution found at .specify/memory/constitution.md - proceeding with constitution-aligned gates

**Quality Gates**:
✓ Single cohesive project scope (interpreter)
✓ Performance requirements justified (1000+ droplets)
✓ Testing strategy comprehensive (property-based testing, constitution-aligned)
✓ Technical complexity appropriate for requirements
✓ Constitution principle compliance verified (Test-Driven Design, Deterministic Execution)

**Structure Decision**: Single project with modular internal structure appropriate for a language interpreter. Clear separation between parsing, execution, operations, and CLI interface.

## Complexity Tracking

**No complexity violations** - Design follows simplicity principles:
- Single cohesive interpreter (not over-engineered)
- Clear separation of concerns with minimal complexity
- Performance optimizations are targeted and justified
- Testing approach is comprehensive but focused on real requirements
