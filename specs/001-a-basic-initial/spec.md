# Feature Specification: Tubular Language Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-basic-initial`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A basic initial implementation of the programming languge described in tubular_spec.md."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Program Execution (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to write and run simple Tubular programs that demonstrate basic flow control and output capabilities. The developer should be able to create programs with pipes, basic data flow, and see output generated from their program.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental capability that demonstrates the language works at all. Without basic execution, no other features matter.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the "Hello, World!" example program and verifying it outputs "Hello, World!" to the console, delivering immediate visual feedback that the interpreter works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid Tubular program with a start symbol `@`, **When** the interpreter is executed, **Then** the program runs without errors and produces output
2. **Given** the Hello World example program, **When** executed, **Then** the console displays "Hello, World!" exactly as specified in the language documentation
3. **Given** a program with only flow control pipes (`|`, `-`, `/`, `\`), **When** executed, **Then** droplets follow the correct paths through the pipe system

### User Story 2 - Data Input/Output Operations (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to create interactive programs that can accept user input and display results. The developer should be able to use all input/output operators including character input, numeric input, character output, and numeric output.

**Why this priority**: Interactive capabilities make the language useful for practical applications and testing algorithms.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a program that reads a number from input, performs a calculation, and outputs the result, demonstrating the complete input-to-output flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a program using `?` character input, **When** a user types "A", **Then** the droplet value becomes 65 (ASCII code for 'A')
2. **Given** a program using `??` numeric input, **When** a user types "42", **Then** the droplet value becomes 42
3. **Given** a program using `,` character output with value 65, **When** executed, **Then** the console displays "A" (without newline)
4. **Given** a program using `n` numeric output with value 42, **When** executed, **Then** the console displays "42" (without newline)

---

### User Story 3 - Complex Computational Logic (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to implement algorithms that require loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, and memory management. The developer should be able to use the data stack, arithmetic operators, and conditional branching pipes to create sophisticated programs.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the language is Turing-complete and can solve real computational problems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the countdown example program which uses loops, decrements, output, and conditional logic to count down from 5 to 1.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the countdown example program, **When** executed, **Then** the output shows numbers 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 each on a separate line
2. **Given** a program using stack operations (`:`, `;`, `d`), **When** executed, **Then** values are correctly pushed, popped, and duplicated according to stack semantics
3. **Given** a program using arithmetic operators (A, S, M, D), **When** executed, **Then** calculations produce correct mathematical results
4. **Given** a program using conditional pipes (`/`, `\`), **When** droplets with different values pass through, **Then** they follow different paths based on zero vs non-zero values

---

### User Story 4 - Memory and Subroutine Operations (Priority: P4)

A developer needs to implement complex data structures and reusable code using the reservoir memory and subroutine call system. The developer should be able to store data in 2D memory coordinates and call/retrieve from subroutines.

**Why this priority**: These advanced features enable more complex programs and code organization, essential for larger projects.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a program that stores a value in the reservoir, retrieves it, performs an operation, and uses a subroutine call to demonstrate both memory and function capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a program using reservoir operations (G, P), **When** coordinates and values are provided, **Then** data is correctly stored and retrieved from memory
2. **Given** a program using subroutine operations (C, R), **When** called, **Then** execution jumps to the subroutine location and returns correctly
3. **Given** multiple subroutine calls in sequence, **When** executed, **Then** the call stack properly manages nested calls and returns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when droplets collide in the same cell during the same tick?
- How does system handle division by zero in arithmetic operations?
- What occurs when trying to pop from an empty data stack?
- How are invalid or unrecognized characters in the program grid handled?
- What happens when a droplet moves outside the program grid boundaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse ASCII grid files and interpret each character position as a potential program element
- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize execution at the `@` symbol with a droplet having value 0 and direction Down
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute programs in discrete ticks, moving each active droplet one cell per tick in its current direction
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement all flow control pipes: `|` (vertical), `-` (horizontal), `^` (up), `/` and `\` (conditional corners)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle droplet collision by annihilating both droplets when they enter the same cell in the same tick
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement data sources: `0`-`9` (numbers), `>` (tape reader), `?` (character input), `??` (numeric input)
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement data sinks: `!` (output sink), `,` (character output), `n` (numeric output)
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement unary operators: `+` (increment), `~` (decrement)
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement data stack operations: `:` (push), `;` (pop), `d` (duplicate), A (add), S (subtract), M (multiply), D (divide), `=` (equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `%` (modulo)
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement reservoir memory operations: G (get), P (put) with support for negative coordinates
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement subroutine operations: C (call), R (return) with call stack management
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle edge cases: division by zero returns 0, stack underflow returns 0, modulo by zero returns 0
- **FR-013**: System MUST support minimum grid size of 1000x1000 cells
- **FR-014**: System MUST support minimum data stack depth of 1000 levels
- **FR-015**: System MUST support arbitrary precision integers for computations

### Key Entities

- **Droplet**: The fundamental execution unit containing an integer value and travel direction (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Program Grid**: A 2D array of ASCII characters representing the static program structure
- **Data Stack**: A LIFO stack for temporary value storage during computation
- **Reservoir**: A 2D random-access memory grid with unbounded coordinates for data storage
- **Call Stack**: A stack for managing subroutine calls, storing return positions and directions
- **Tick**: The discrete time unit in which all active droplets move simultaneously

- **SC-004**: The interpreter correctly handles edge cases (division by zero, stack underflow, etc.) without crashing or producing undefined behavior
- **SC-005**: Programs utilizing all major language features (I/O, arithmetic, memory, subroutines) can be executed to completion
- **SC-006**: The interpreter processes programs up to the maximum grid size (1000x1000) without memory errors or crashes
