# Subroutine Test Program
# Demonstrates subroutine Call (C) and Return (R) operations
#
# This program:
# 1. Calls a subroutine at (0, 5) that prints "Hello"
# 2. Calls a subroutine at (0, 10) that prints "World"
# 3. Demonstrates nested calls
# 4. Shows proper return behavior

# Main program starts here
