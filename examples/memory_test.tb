# Memory Test Program
# Demonstrates reservoir Put (P) and Get (G) operations
#
# This program:
# 1. Stores value 42 at coordinate (7, 15)
# 2. Stores value 99 at coordinate (10, 20)
# 3. Retrieves the value from (7, 15) and outputs it
# 4. Retrieves the value from (10, 20) and outputs it
# 5. Demonstrates that uninitialized memory returns 0

7           # Set x-coordinate for memory operations
:
15          # Set y-coordinate for first memory operation
:
42          # Set value to store
P           # Put 42 at coordinate (7, 15)

10          # Set x-coordinate for second memory operation
:
20          # Set y-coordinate for second memory operation
:
99          # Set value to store
P           # Put 99 at coordinate (10, 20)

7           # Set x-coordinate for retrieval
:
15          # Set y-coordinate for retrieval
G           # Get value from (7, 15) - should be 42
n,          # Output as number

10          # Set x-coordinate for retrieval
:
20          # Set y-coordinate for retrieval
G           # Get value from (10, 20) - should be 99
n,          # Output as number

5           # Set x-coordinate for uninitialized memory test
:
25          # Set y-coordinate (no value stored here)
G           # Get value from (5, 25) - should be 0
n,          # Output as number

# Expected output: 42,99,0,
