## Project Notes

Key takeaways from Elements of Style for the tubular project:
1. Omit needless words - this directly applies to technical documentation where brevity improves clarity
2. Use active voice - makes instructions more direct and actionable for users
3. Use definite, specific language - reduces ambiguity in technical specifications
4. Keep related words together - important for complex technical explanations
5. Write in a way that comes naturally - avoids overly formal or stilted technical writing

These principles will be useful for future documentation updates, code comments, and API documentation in the project.
