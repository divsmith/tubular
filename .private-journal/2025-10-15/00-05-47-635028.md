## Project Notes

Current project state assessment:
- Many deleted example files (basic_test_from_root.tb, debug_*.tb, etc.)
- Modified core files: README.md, src/interpreter/execution.rs, tests
- New untracked files suggest new direction: Makefile, test_*.tb files
- Branch is "001-a-basic-initial" - suggests early stage implementation

The self-hosting goal is a significant undertaking that requires:
1. Complete language implementation
2. Parser that can handle the full language syntax
3. Either: 
   - Interpreter that can run its own source code, or
   - Compiler that can compile the interpreter source

Current state appears to be in transition/flux.
